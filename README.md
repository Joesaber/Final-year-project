Mathematical modeling of flatbread baking process
Radiatiation, hconv_conveyer, hconv_product, hconv_ext, hconv_int are functions that calculates heat transfer coefficients, and are used in the design.
design4 and des4 solve the sysytem of equatons for known baking time and length.
design3 and des3 solve the system for a production rate inputed by the user.
